# OCPP Simulator

## Introduction
This project is a Python-based OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) simulator designed to mimic the behavior of electric vehicle charging stations. It supports OCPP versions 1.6 and 2.0, enabling developers and testers to simulate charging station operations and interactions with a central system.

## Features
- Simulation of charging station operations.
- Support for OCPP 1.6 and 2.0.
- Customizable scenarios for testing different cases.
- Logging and monitoring of messages between the charge point and central system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
